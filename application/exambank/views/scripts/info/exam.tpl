    <h2>What is an Exam?</h2>
<p>To understand how best to use the exam bank, it helps to understand what the purpose of exams is.</p>

<p>In the old British system from which Canadian universities took their inspiration, one earned an undergraduate degree by passing a series of examinations at the very end of one's studies. Needless to say, many students slacked off until a few weeks before the exams (or, for the good students, a few months) and then panicked. The credit system was brought in as a more humane alternative. This divides the knowledge contained in a degree program into a bunch of one-term chunks and puts an exam at the end of each.</p>

<p>But this still leaves open the possibility that students will not make enough progress during the term to pass the final exam. So graded assignments (weekly or biweekly) were added so that students could make regular, metered progress, and a midterm was added so that students would have practice in writing an exam before the final. The final exam, being the last thing done in the course, is an assessment -- the mark is supposed to assess how well a student has learned the material.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of assignments is to help students understand the material and to gain practice in the skills being tested. They're not really for assessment, because they are part of the learning process. So why are they worth some fraction of the final mark, if they're not assessment? Because if they aren't worth anything, students won't do them, and then they won't do well on the final exam.</p>

<p>This is the same reason that the midterm is worth some fraction of the final mark, even though it's supposed to serve a diagnostic purpose and identify weaknesses in time for students to correct them before the final. Unfortunately, this makes it too easy to just focus on that contribution to the final mark, instead of the purpose.</p>

<p>Cramming for the midterm, or studying old midterms to try to do better on the midterm, is a little like drinking a lot of water before going to see your doctor for a blood test. You may dilute your blood enough so that your cholesterol level is low enough to \"pass\" the test, but that's not going to prevent a heart attack if your blood cholesterol is really high. Similarly, cramming for the midterm only hides weaknesses that should be corrected before the final exam, which is typically worth a lot more.</p>

<p>Exambank midterms are thus of limited value. They give you a sense of the kinds of questions that are likely to be asked, but you can probably already guess. Most midterm questions look like easy assignment questions. They have to be doable in a relatively short amount of time, and they are supposed to give you a sense of where you are weak. If you've done the assignments and learned from your mistakes there, you are supposed to be in good shape. Thus midterm questions will tend to test the same skills that assignment questions reinforce.</p>

<p>The final exam is not diagnostic. There is no chance to learn from your errors and do better, because it's the last thing you do in the course. The final exam is an assessment of what you have learned. In this case, the exam bank can be of some value, but only if you use it properly.</p>

<p>How do instructors make up final exams? Exam questions can't look too much like assignment questions, because they must distinguish students who just memorize assignment solutions but don't really understand the material from students who have learned and understood the material. So exam questions tend to rely on new situations, or modifications to old situations, but where it is clear that the concepts and techniques learned in the course can be applied. Instructors can also check the exam bank to see what old exams are there, just as students can. So the final exam is unlikely to be almost identical to previous final exams, to the midterm or previous midterms, or to assignments in the course.</p>
