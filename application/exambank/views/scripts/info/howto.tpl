    <h2>How To Best Study for an Exam</h2>
    <p>From <a href='info_exam.php'>'What is an Exam'</a>, we can determine that the best way to use old final exams is in a simulation of your upcoming exam, late in your studying. Put aside the time required for the old exam, and then sit down and write out complete solutions, as if the old exam were your exam. Because courses change from term to term, some of the old questions may not be appropriate, and you will have to skip them and adjust your time accordingly.</p>

    <p>If a course has recently been revised and the old final exams are not useful, you can get together with a friend, each of you making up questions for the other. The act of making up questions will itself help reveal any potential weaknesses in your understanding. Then swap question sheets and do a simulation as above. Finally, compare answers, and resolve any differences.</p>

    <p>You should avoid using questions on old exams as a guide to what to study, and avoid focussing on solving those particular sorts of questions. Your instructor may have a different idea of what to emphasize. Old exams may be more difficult or more easy than the one you will write. You should also avoid looking at solutions to old exams until you have written out complete solutions to the questions. Studying solutions is not active learning; you are not solving problems, just reading. Understanding examples is important in the early stages of learning, not a few days before the final exam.</p>

    <p>The worst thing you can do with old exam solutions is to try to memorize them in the hopes that you can just change a few numbers or words and get a solution to a question on the exam you will write. Markers can usually tell when a student is parroting something they do not fully understand. You're better off taking the time to understand the concepts and techniques in full generality. You can lose marks for saying too much that is irrelevant, even if it is correct, or by mixing in incorrect statements with correct statements. If you cannot fully answer a question, be honest about it, and write out the parts of which you are sure, as long as they are making genuine progress towards a complete solution. You cannot earn part marks by random stabs.</p>

    <p>Above all, you should keep in mind the purpose of each of the components of a course. The assignment of a numerical grade as a measure of how well you have learned the material in a course is pretty artificial. If you focus on what the number is supposed to be measuring and spend your time improving your grasp of the material rather than trying to get that number to be higher by any means possible, you will find that in the end, the number will be higher, for the right reasons. That's a win-win situation.</p>

    <h2>Extra Help</h2>
    <p>There are many tools available besides the Exambank to help you do your best on exams.  Many professors, TAs, or tutors will run review sessions and hold extra office hours in the days leading up to an exam.  These are probably the most valuable assets in your studying arsenal as they are the people that know the most about what you are going to have to know.</p>
