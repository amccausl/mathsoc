  <dl>
    <dt>Why should I join a club?</dt>

go to events that the club organizes, or even run for an executive position and
develop some people skills, it's your call!</dd>

    <dt>What do Clubs do? What's their purpose?</dt>
    <dd>The purpose of a club is to further academic and social activities within a particular department(s) or non-departmental programme of the Faculty of Mathematics. A Club shall carry out activities of a particular interest to students within that academic major plan.</dd>

    <dt>How do they benefit students?</dt>
    <dd>Clubs benefit students by running events (these range from fun club
activities like movie and poker nights, to special speakers who come in to
talk with students who attend) and offering other services to them (this

    <dt>Do I need to be a member to go to these club organized events?</dt>

up to the discretion of the club in question.</dd>
