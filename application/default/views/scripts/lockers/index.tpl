  <p>If you're tired of carrying your books around campus, MathSoc has a solution for you.  There are many lockers available on the 3rd floor of the Math and Computers building.  Any student can <a href="{$baseUrl}/lockers/signup">sign up for one here</a> for a term.  At the beginning of next term you will have to renew your locker if you don't want to empty it, otherwise it will be emptied for you.  If your locker is emptied you will be emailed and the contents will be stored in the MathSoc office (MC3038) for one month, at which point they will be moved to police services.  Each student may only have one locker.  If you have any further questions they should be directed to {mailto address="office@mathsoc.uwaterloo.ca"}</p>
