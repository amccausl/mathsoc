<h2>Student Clubs</h2>

<p>Mathsoc is host to a variety of clubs that provide representation and support to incoming students. To contact the club that represents you, see the <a href="/Clubs" style="color:blue;">Mathsoc Clubs page</a>. For information on all the clubs together, <a href="/documents/Clubs and Affiliates of Mathsoc.pdf" style="color:blue;">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Note that although clubs exist to represent a large fraction that of the Mathematics population, not every program has a club to represent it. However, students enrolled in Math/CA, FARM, or any other Math/Business program can contact the <a href="http://ddclub.ca" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">Double Degree Club</a>. The <a href="http://asa.uwaterloo.ca" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">UW Accounting Students Association</a> can also provide support for students enrolled in Math/CA, and the <a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca" target="_blank" style="color:blue">Computer Science Club</a> can provide support for Software Engineering students.</p>
