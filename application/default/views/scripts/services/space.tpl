  <h2>Student Space</h2>
  <p>MathSoc is in charge of a lot of the student space in the MC. The Comfy and C&amp;D lounges are great places to study, eat, play games, or just relax between classes. We ask that you keep these spaces as clean as possible by ensuring your garbage goes in the garbage cans and all spills are reported to custodial staff promptly. We ask that students do not sleep in the lounges as it leads to a less comfortable environment for everyone else. Also, we ask that students do not remove funiture from the lounge.</p>

  <p>There are many events that happen in the Comfy on a weekly basis including Games Nights on Wednesdays where you can hang out and play some board games with your fellow students and Movie Nights on Thursdays where two new movies are shown every week for free.</p>

  <p>If you would like to book the Comfy for an event, please e-mail or talk to the VPAS. Non-MathSoc clubs are allowed only one booking of the Comfy Lounge per term.</p>
