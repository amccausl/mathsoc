  <p>A major goal of the society is to promote and co-ordinate student participation in academic activities and to aid in and give a forum for student representation within the faculty of Mathematics and the University of Waterloo as a whole.  To this end MathSoc provides some academic services you might find helpful.</p>

  <p>We run an <a href="{$baseUrl}/exambank">online exambank</a> so students can get copies of previous exams as study aids.  We also organize <a href="{$baseUrl}/Academics/Representation">math's student representation</a> on many academic committees.</p>
