  <p>Math students hold seats on many different councils and boards on campus.  The volume of administration makes it difficult to figure out where a specific academic concerns should be raised.  This is the job of the VPA.  They coordinate math seats on various councils to make sure your opinions and questions get to the person representing you on the issue.  If you ever have an academic concern, drop an email to {mailto address="vpa@mathsoc.uwaterloo.ca"} and he/she can help get it resolved.</p>

  <p>You should also email the VPA if your interested in representing students on academic issues.  This system only works if we have a voice to fill each seat.  If you think you'd be interested but you're wondering what some of these bodies are and what they do, continue reading.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://sharepoint.uwaterloo.ca/sites/DOM/FacultyCouncil/default.aspx">Mathematics Faculty Council</a> refers to the Full Governing Body and includes all Mathematics regular faculty as members. The full council meets only twice per year - in March and September. Their <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/About/minutes_fc/fc_constitution.shtml">constitution</a> lists the Membership, Powers, and Duties of the council. This council decides, subject to Senate approval (see below), the courses of study in the faculty of mathematics and the conditions for admission as well as the ability to form whatever other committees it deems are necessary. Faculty council meets on the 3rd Tuesday of September, and the 3rd Tuesday of March.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://sharepoint.uwaterloo.ca/sites/DOM/FacultyCouncil/default.aspx">Representative Council</a> is a subset of the Faculty Council, and has powers delegated to it by Faculty Council. Representatives from the academic units are either appointed or elected to serve on the council. Representative Council is the 'operating' body and meets monthly from September through May.  Representative Council meets on the 3rd Tuesday of each month, from September through May. Meetings are usually held in MC 5158 at 3:30 PM.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/mfcf/asking-for-help/CAC/>Computing Advisory Committee</a> (CAC) is chaired by the Associate Dean Computing, Math. It advises the Associate Dean Computing on issues such as policies, long range planning, and equipment. However, the CAC has not met for sometime as the Associate Dean Computing, Math position has not been filled.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/WIM/index.shtml">Women in Math Committee</a> is advisory to the Dean of Mathematics on issues relating to the status of women faculty, staff and students in the Faculty of Mathematics.</p>

  <p>In addition to the committees at the Faculty level there are also committees that are university wide.  The UW Senate is the highest decision making body with regards to the academics of the institution.  Additionally, UW has a Board of Governors which is the highest decision making body with respect to the property and revenues of the University as well as transactions of university business.  Both of these bodies have delegated much of their authority to various committees.  Students are represented though various undergraduate members of these committees, as well as the Senate and the Board of Governors.</p>
