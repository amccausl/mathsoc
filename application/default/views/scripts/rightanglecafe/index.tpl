  <p>The C&amp;D offers a cheap food alternative on campus. They are located on the third floor of the MC right next to the Comfy Lounge. They take cash and they also have a debit machine.</p>

  <p>Some of their specials include Mac and Cheese on most Mondays, and Veggie and Meat Chili on most Fridays as well as one or more soups every day. Also available for lunch everyday are a large array of sandwiches, salads, and a selection of Halal Indian food.</p>

  <p>If you're looking for drinks there is: coffee and tea, juice, pop, milk, water and more.</p>

  <p>And if you're just in the mood for a snack they have chips, ice cream, candy and chocolate bars - for cheaper than you can get from the vending machines - as well as an assortment of cookies and pastries.</p>

  <p>If you have an event on campus, the C&amp;D would be happy to provide catering. If you are having a lunch meeting and would like some sandwiches or just some coffee and treats, the C&amp;D is able to cater and deliver on campus. Please contact the manager by phone or walk-in for more information.</p>
